# Homework 10

## Working with Named Objects

1. Update the module from the previous `module`: [homework9.move](https://github.com/GideonBature/encode-aptos_move/blob/main/exercises/exercise_9/sources/homework9.move), where you created a normal object to create a named object instead. You can choose the name.

2. Add a view function to your module to return the address of the named object.
